Hamburger is an app that lets users input the names of burgers they can think of. 
The user submits a burger type and the app will display the burger on the left side of the site page with a devour button. 
When the submit button is clicked the burger is stored into a database.
When the user clicks the devour button the burger will move to the right side of the page.
